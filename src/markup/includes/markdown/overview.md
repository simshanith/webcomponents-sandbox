# Web Components Sandbox

## Tinkering in the labs with tomorrow's tech

Web Components address many of the problems Web developers face everyday:

* Code reusability
* Dependency Management
* Network Optimization
* Meaningful, Semantic Markup

Web Components are a broad set of emerging standards that modern browsers are implementing today. They are designed for progressive enhancement, leveraging feature detection and a strong basis in semantic markup so older browsers still receive the meaningful content. The main new features that are considered Web Component components (how meta) are:

* HTML `<template>` tag
* Shadow DOM
* Custom Elements (e.g. `<polymer-ajax>`)
* HTML Imports (the current focus of this sandbox)
